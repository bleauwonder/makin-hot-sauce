**Mixin' Hot Sauce Game**

## This game is a bit of a gamble. At the start of the game, the Computer will choose a random number. Each button at the bottom will also have a random number, which when pressed, will add up to a total. To win, match your total with the Computer's total. To lose, go above the computer's number. 

## This is a great game for kids and adults alike, once you get the hang of it, it'll be smooth sailing!

## Clicking the buttons is the name of the game here. So it's all about mouse clicks.
