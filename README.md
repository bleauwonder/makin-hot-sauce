# Makin' Hot Sauce

## **A Big Hot Sauce Game**

### This front-end game is a bit of a gamble. At the start of the game, the Computer will choose a random number. Each button at the bottom will also have a random number, which when pressed, will add up to a total. To win, match your total with the Computer's total. To lose, go above the computer's number. 

### This is a great game for kids and adults alike, once you get the hang of it, it'll be smooth sailing!

### Clicking the buttons is the name of the game here. So it's all about mouse clicks.

### This needed functional logic that included global and local variables, as well as buttons that separately created random numbers for each round. I had to learn how to write functions to generate a random number and make sure to keep that same random number per button for the round. Making the random number function global and then creating an array for the buttons fixed this issue.
